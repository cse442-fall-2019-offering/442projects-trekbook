# Documenting the Current Work
* On Android, we have done most of the front end work to be able to edit the pins that we drop.

# What went Wrong?
* When we want to edit a pin, the front end changes will be impermanent and will not actually change the information on the server
* OR You will submit an entirely different pin

# How to Fix this?
* We will have to discuss if the best solution to this is to make an edit api
* OR have a marker id hash associated with the marker so that if the backend sees the same id, it is able to alter rather than add info
