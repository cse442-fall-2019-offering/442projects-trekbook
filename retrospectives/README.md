# What are retrospective?
We will be using this for stories that were left in a sprint and were not finished

We will need to document the work done on the story and the major roadblock that we ran into while trying to complete it. Lastly, we must say what we are going to do to avoid any mistakes made on the ticket for next sprint

## Procurement
Make a section for what got done, what went wrong, and how we will fix it
